<h1>About uCorp</h1>
<p>At uCorp, we believe world-class audio experiences should be within everyoneâ€™s reach. Our speakers, subwoofers and SoundPath audio accessories refute the notion that exceptional sound quality has to be ridiculously expensive. The uCorp design approach involves a fusion of leading edge technology, precision engineering, exhaustive lab and real-world testing, as well as, a deep personal passion for audio excellence, all brought to life by our acoustic engineers. With every new product, we strive to redefine audio performance for the price.</p>
